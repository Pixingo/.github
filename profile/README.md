# Pixingo Architecture

## [Pixingo AL2 (Web app)](https://pixingo.com/)
This is where a majority of the code of this project is held. This contains the API and the frontend all in one repository.

### Technologies Used:
Angular, Node.js, MySQL, AWS Lambda, AWS S3, AWS SQS, AWS RDS, AWS CodePipeline, Tailwind.css

## [Pixingo 3 ("mobile site")](https://m.pixingo.com/)
This is the "mobile-friendly" site. It features a more streamlined approach towards checking out cards, where users do not have the ability to customize cards in the studio like the al2 site does. But the checkout process is much faster. This site contains many links to the original site.

### Technologies Used:
Vue, Nuxt, Tailwind.css, Netlify

## [ByDesign](https://admin.securefreedom.com/Pixingo/login.aspx?page=%2fPixingo%2fDefault.asp%3f&strmsg=)
ByDesign is used primarily for handling payments. It it also used for managing customers and products. This is a core part of the API's architecture.
